This is a website where you can send messages in real-time. When the user sends a message it will be stored in the MongoDB database and since MongoDB is not a real-time database,
 we will use a package by the name of pusher to send the message to MongoDB and get it back in real-time

I used (HTML, CSS, JS, ReactJs, NodeJs, ExpressJs, MongoDB, Mongoose, SCSS, MaterialUI) to build this project.
